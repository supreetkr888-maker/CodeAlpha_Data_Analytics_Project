## 🧹 Task 1: Web Scraping — *Books to Scrape*

### 🔍 Objective

Extract book titles, prices, and availability information from **BooksToScrape.com** using Python and BeautifulSoup, and store the data in a structured CSV format.

### 🛠️ Tools Used

* Python
* requests
* BeautifulSoup
* pandas

### 🚀 What I Did

* Fetched HTML content using `requests`
* Parsed book details using `BeautifulSoup`
* Created a structured dataset and saved it as a CSV file

### 📁 Output

* **File:** `books_data.csv`

## 📊 Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) — *Blinkit Dataset*

### 🔍 Objective

Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis on the Blinkit dataset to uncover trends, patterns, and business insights.

### 🛠️ Tools Used

* Python
* pandas
* matplotlib
* seaborn

### 🚀 What I Did

* Handled missing values and cleaned the dataset
* Explored relationships between product features, outlet characteristics, and sales
* Performed statistical summaries and visual analysis

---

### 🔍 Analysis Overview

* Explored variables such as **Product Fat Content, Outlet Size, Outlet Location Tier, Outlet Establishment Year, and Sales**
* Compared sales performance across **product categories, outlet formats, and geographic tiers**
* Analyzed trends using **bar charts, trend plots, and comparative summaries**

---

### 📈 Key Insights

* **Low-fat products outperform regular-fat products**, indicating strong customer preference for healthier options
* **Medium-sized outlets generate the highest revenue**, followed by small outlets
* **Tier 3 locations contribute the most to total sales**, while Tier 1 locations contribute the least
* **Older outlets (established around 1998)** show significantly higher sales due to customer trust and brand presence
* **Outlets established during 2010–2011 underperform**, while newer outlets show steady but moderate sales

---

### 🎯 Business Takeaways

* Focus on **high-performing product categories and outlet sizes**
* Expand presence in **Tier 2 and Tier 3 locations**
* Re-strategize **low-performing outlets and highly competitive Tier 1 markets**
